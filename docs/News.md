## README

* Data in portal represents cases signed-out through the end of September 2020 and includes mutation, copy number and fusion data. For more information, please refer to the [FAQs](https://cbioportal.ucsf.edu/cbioportal/faq) page ("What data types are in the portal?"). 
    * We will be doing new data releases approximately every 2-3 months
* Report-derived pathogenicity annotations are not yet displayed in portal 
* There are several known bugs we have reported to the cBioPortal development team:
   * H3F3A variants are showing up as H3F3B variants in portal!
* Some fusions as well as SNPs/small indels are not showing up in the portal; we are in the process of investigating the source cause of this.
* Primary site
   * This is derived directly from the UCSF500 report and actually represents the source location of the biopsy; therefore it might not represent the true primary site of the tumor per se. We are working on obtaining the true primary site for cases in the portal.
